## This directory contains test cases designed to test a mock parking cost calculator at https://www.shino.de/parkcalc/

### The objective is to practice test design and writing simple test cases, utilising black box test techniques such as equivalence partition and boundary value analysis.
### Test automation scripts will be based on the test cases, so they should be planned accordingly, with enough detail provided to automate steps.
